                        <p>Randy M. Feldman D.D.S, M.S., Chief Smile Officer of Feldman offers advice on the subject of finding the right orthodontist in this video and blog.<p>
                        <p>Initially everyone is going to Google some names and that's a good place to start, because you will come up with 3 or 4 different names. But then you want to look at, you know, the locations, number of years in practice, and their reputation.</p>
                        <p>In addition to that, probably the best thing is word to mouth. If you already have a dentist ask for a referral. Ask trusted friends who have experience with local orthodontists. What you will find is that 2 or 3 names keep repeating themselves. I’d always tell people to get 2 if not 3 opinions. Some people will get more than that. I don't think it's really necessary, unless the opinions are different. If the opinions are the same, then if the first two are the same then that's it. But if not, I'd probably get a third opinion. But these are the common things that you want to look for. Someone's experience, what their reputation is in the community, how involved they are in the community, I think that's very important too. People that give back usually care about the community and they are not just about the bottom line.</p>
                        <p>Hoping that when you ask around, my name comes up often and in high regard. I encourage you to read our reviews and to view our clients’ smiles.</p>
